This site will be a ongoing digital journal of everything I find interesting in the universe. From my trials and tribulations of building <a href="https://bareblends.com.au">Bare Blends</a> with <a href="https://github.com/razza12">razza</a>, to my random programming adventures, to my strange obsession with SpaceX, to my thoughts on the meta of the world.

Hopefully some of my thoughts are portrayed elegantly enough you are able to stay engaged.

## Starting with how this site is made...


This is mostly for the programming nerds, so if you are not interested in programming then this is probably not your cup of tea.

What better way to experiment with new tech than on a personal site! And golly does the web move fast.

### The site is:
tldr; Nuxt + Nuxt Content + Tailwind + Netlify
<a href="https://github.com/oscarmanderj/personal-site">(Find source here)</a>
<ul>
    <li>$0 for ever (excluding domain name)</li>
    <li>SEO optimal & fully static</li>
    <li>0 lines of custom CSS</li>
    <li>Optimised for reading via nuxt content</li>
    <li>Publishable via github</li>
</ul>



 

## Tailwind
<a href="https://v1.tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>
